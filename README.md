# ChatGPT in Slack

Introducing a transformative app for Slack users, specifically designed to enhance your communication with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)!
This app enables seamless interaction with ChatGPT via Slack channels, optimizing your planning and writing processes by leveraging AI technology.

Discover the app's functionality by installing the live demo from https://bit.ly/chat-gpt-in-slack. 
Keep in mind that the live demo is personally hosted by [@seratch](https://github.com/seratch).
For corporate Slack workspaces, we strongly advise deploying the app on your own infrastructure using the guidelines provided below.

## How It Works

You can interact with ChatGPT as you do on the website. 

While communicating in the same thread, the bot remembers what you have already said:

Consider this realistic scenario: ask the bot to generate a business email for communicating with your manager:

With ChatGPT, you don't need to ask a perfectly formulated question at first. Adjusting the details after receiving the bot's initial response is a great approach:

Doesn't that sound cool? ðŸ˜Ž

## Three Supported Interfaces

There are three interfaces to use. When you want to share a conversation with others in the Slack workspace, always using channel threads is the best option. If you wish to use ChatGPT privately, the other interfaces are more convenient for that purpose.

1. Talk to the bot in a channel thread
2. Talk to the bot in a 1:1 DM
3. Send prompts on your Home tab

### Talk to the bot in a channel thread

This is the most common way to use this app. You can start a conversation with ChatGPT Bot at any time just by mentioning the bot in a thread's initial message. Within the thread, you don't need to mention the bot anymore:

### Talk to the bot in a 1:1 DM

You can privately ask for help using a 1:1 DM with the bot. No need to mention the bot. Just send a message in the DM:

### Send prompts on your Home tab

On the Home tab, in addition to the OpenAI API key and model configuration, you can use the quick proofreader and free prompt sender dialogs. These are so handy that you can quickly send inquiries to OpenAI, even from a mobile device.

Here is an example of proofreading on Home tab:

You can generate an image just by giving a prompt to the DALL-E 3 model too:

To ask any other questions, you can use the from-scratch modal instead:

## Running the App for Company Workspaces

Confidentiality of information is top priority for businesses.

This app is open-sourced! so please feel free to fork it and deploy the app onto the infrastructure that you manage.
After going through the above local development process, you can deploy the app using `Dockerfile`, which is placed at the root directory.

The `Dockerfile` is designed to establish a WebSocket connection with Slack via Socket Mode.
This means that there's no need to provide a public URL for communication with Slack.

## Contributions

You're always welcome to contribute! :raised_hands:
When you make changes to the code in this project, please keep these points in mind:
- When making changes to the app, please avoid anything that could cause breaking behavior. If such changes are absolutely necessary due to critical reasons, like security issues, please start a discussion in GitHub Issues before making significant alterations.
- When you have the chance, please write some unit tests. Especially when you touch internal utility modules (e.g., `app/markdown.py` etc.) and add/edit the code that do not call any web APIs, writing tests should be relatively easy.
- Before committing your changes, be sure to run `./validate.sh`. The script runs black (code formatter), flake8 and pytype (static code analyzers).
